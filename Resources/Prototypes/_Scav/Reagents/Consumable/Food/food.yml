#This was set up with yinglet food restrictions in mind, if other species that cant have grain at all exist, some changes needed
#most notably, should add WetGrain to food items still using nutriment like noodles (TODO)


#may want to split into gluten and starch as well in the future

#Protein
#TODO: separate animal and plant proteins
