# ZERO TOLERANCE RULES

The rules below are absolute. Players caught violating them may be banned without prior warning.

  - Players must be at least 18 years of age to play on this server. Any player under 18 years old will be banned until they are of age.
  - Absolutely no erotic roleplay (ERP). Occasional innuendos/sexual references are acceptable, but no actual ERP. Keep it PG-13.
  - Absolutely no hate speech, including slurs, bigotry, racism, sexism, or ableism. IC specism toward other characters is acceptable within reason, but if an admin or player in looc tells you to cool it, back off.

  - Do not use exploits, cheats, or external programs to gain an unfair advantage or disrupt the server in any way.
  - Do not attempt to evade game bans or job/role bans.
